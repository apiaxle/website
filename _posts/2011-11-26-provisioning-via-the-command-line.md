ApiAxle comes with its own repl where you can run commands which
create/manipulate Apis/Keys/Keyrings.

Firstly, make sure you have the repl installed:

    $ [sudo] npm install -g apiaxle-repl
    
Now you can run it:

    $ apiaxle

You'll see a prompt. Type `help` and you'll see a list of top-level
commands that you can run. Once you have those then just type
`help <command>` and you'll get information about the specific command.
