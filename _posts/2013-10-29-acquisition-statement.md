I'm very proud to announce that ApiAxle is now a member of the
[Exicon](http://exiconglobal.com) family.

ApiAxle started out as a side project about two years ago when I was
CTO at Qwerly and we found our API management provider didn't quite
fit our needs. API growth had already exploded back then, and so in
the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or
webservers, it seemed like there should be an OSS API management
solution. About six months ago I decided to take ApiAxle into the
commercial realm and start selling support for it whilst I built out
the management toolkits. In this time, downloads went from tens a
month to about 400 a month, ApiAxle was picked up by some big names,
and, the product has improved leaps and bounds.

## Exicon

[Exicon](http://exiconglobal.com) provides cutting-edge app management
solutions that simplify the creation, deployment and management of
mobile applications. They were founded in 2007, based in Hong Kong and
San Fran√ßois under a digital startup incubator, Catalist. They have an
excellent,
[curated API directory](http://app.exiconglobal.com/api-dir/) which
complements what ApiAxle does well.

## What will happen to ApiAxle?

Exicon fully intends to keep pushing development forward with
ApiAxle. The project will get a huge boost in resources, not just
development but also some great advisers not least in the Exicon CEO,
Stefan Rust and CTO, Terry Wong. I will remain as the ApiAxle product
owner and the OSS component will live on and continue to improve.
