I'm very proud to announce that ApiAxle is now a member of the
[Exicon](http://exiconglobal.com) family.

ApiAxle started out as a side project about two years ago when I was
CTO at Qwerly and we found our API management provider didn't quite
fit our needs. API growth had already exploded back then, and so in
the same way you could pick from a plethora of databases or
webservers, it seemed like there should be an OSS API management
solution. About six months ago I decided to take ApiAxle into the
commercial realm and start selling support for it whilst I built out
the management toolkits. In this time downloads went from tens a month
to about 400 a month, ApiAxle were picked up by some big names and the
product has improved leaps and bounds.

## Exicon

[Exicon](http://exiconglobal.com) specialises in the app life-cycle,
that is, everything trough helping companies to define their
application's needs, finding developers, hosting and managing the
APIs, metrics and, growth and marketing. ApiAxle fits perfectly into
their model, as well as their technology stack.

## What will happen to ApiAxle?

Exicon fully intends to keep pushing development forward with
ApiAxle. The project will get a huge boost in resources, not just
development but also some great advisers not least in the Exicon CEO,
Stefan Rust. I will remain as the product owner and the OSS component
will live on and keep improving at a steady pace.
