Watch this
[screencast describing how to install ApiAxle](http://blog.apiaxle.com/post/installation-screencast/) by running through the below instructions.

## Prerequisites

### Base system

There are some base libraries you will need on a fresh install. Ubuntu
users might want to make sure the following has been run:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties \
                           build-essential \
                           libxml2-dev

### Node.js

Only versions **0.8** and above are supported. Here's the official
[documentation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).

Ubuntu users
[should use this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/node.js/). Which
would have you do the following:

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chris-lea/node.js
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install nodejs

### Redis

Redis is an advanced key/value store. It's where ApiAxle stores its
data. Find [the installation instructions](http://redis.io/download)
on redis.io. Ubuntu users:

    $ sudo apt-get install redis-server

## ApiAxle

With the above finished you should just be able to do this:

    $ [sudo] npm install -g apiaxle-repl \
                            apiaxle-proxy \
                            apiaxle-api

Now those commands exist in your `PATH`.

### Trying it with the Facebook Api

Lets say you want to put the Facebook graph API behind a proxy. Here's
how you might do it:

Start the proxy service with this command:

    $ apiaxle-proxy 3000

It'll now listen on port `3000`. If you now hit http://localhost:3000/
you'll get an `ApiUnknown` error message. That's because ApiAxle
decides which API you want to use via subdomains. Put this line in
your `/etc/hosts` file:

    127.0.0.1 facebook.api.localhost

Now when you hit http://facebook.api.localhost:3000/ you'll see the
same error but with a slightly different message. That's because
ApiAxle doesn't know *how* to call facebook. Open the apiaxle repl:

    $ apiaxle

and then run these commands:

    axle> api facebook create endPoint="graph.facebook.com"

Now create and link an API key:

    axle> key "1234" create
    axle> api facebook linkkey "1234"

Now try calling the graph API with any of the options you know it
accepts. Here's an example that will print our my information:

    $ curl 'http://facebook.api.localhost:3000/yet.more.information?api_key=1234'

Try it without the key and you'll get an error. If you try to hit the
API more that twice a second you'll get a Qps error.

Under the hood this has been translated to
`graph.facebook.com/yet.more.information`.

### Moving past the testing

Have a look in
[this directory](https://github.com/apiaxle/apiaxle/tree/develop/thirdparty-conf)
for some Nginx and supervisord example configuration which are
production suitable.
