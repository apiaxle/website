  <h2>Open Source</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Read the source</dt>
    <dd>
      Sysadmin concerned about what's happening to your sensitive API
      data? Show them the source. More eyes on the code mean fewer
      mistakes.
    </dd>

    <dt>Contribute features</dt>
    <dd>
      You can get in touch with us to build features for you or you
      can build them yourself and contribute them to ApiAxle via
      Github.
    </dd>

    <dt>Benefit from other peoples changes</dt>
    <dd>
      People already feed back to ApiAxle. You'll benefit from their
      code, reports and features.
    </dd>
  </dl>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Locally hosted</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Minimise latency costs</dt>
    <dd>
      Stick your API behind ApiAxle on the same hardware or via a
      super-fast LAN connection. You don't get that hop over
      the internet you might with a cloud-based provider.
    </dd>
    <dt>It's your data, keep it that way</dt>
    <dd>
      You know exactly where your data is going and who can see it. No
      concerns about someone caching sensitive data for too long
      because you're in charge.
    </dd>
    <dt>Absolute control over infrastructure</dt>
    <dd>
      Choose Nginx, Lighttpd, Varnish, Apache or none of the
      above. Tune Redis to your liking
      or <a href="mailto:support@apiaxle.com">have us do it</a>
      according to your specific API requirements.
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Cost</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Core components are free</dt>
    <dd>
      20 minutes to useful with no cost.
    </dd>
    <dt>Great support rates</dt>
    <dd>
      Our support packages are incredibly competitive and we'll do our
      utmost to optimise your setup from the start. You'll get access
      to a developer, not someone reading from a manual.

<div class="slide">
  <h2>Feature rich</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>Integrate us with your user database</dt>
    <dd>
      The ApiAxle REST API makes it a cinch to integrate us with your
      current user database. Just a few calls and you can plug a user
      into your API and give them a key.
    </dd>
    <dt>Everything you don't want to have to build yourself</dt>
    <dd>
      HMAC token authentication based on secret key and epoch hashing,
      caching, rate limiting, XML/JSON error output, HTTPS support,
      powerful logging.
    </dd>
    <dt>Speed</dt>
    <dd>
      ApiAxle is heavily optimised. We intend to keep it that way.

  <h2>Powerful API</h2>
  <dl>

      update everything. Link/unlink keys to keyrings.
    </dd>
    <dt>Statistics</dt>
    <dd>
      A very powerful statistics system. Captures all events for a an
      API. View results in real-time or spread over a large
      period. You get all of this and can query it for arbitrary time
