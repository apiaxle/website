## Can I host my API at somewhere other than myapi.api.domain?

Yes. Using Nginx or other load balancing tools you should pass through
the `Host` header. For example if your API is called Acme and there
are four processes running on ports 3000-3003:

    upstream apiaxle_cluster {
      server 127.0.0.1:3000;
      server 127.0.0.1:3001;
      server 127.0.0.1:3002;
      server 127.0.0.1:3003;
    }

    server {
      listen 80;

      location / {
        proxy_pass http://apiaxle_cluster;
        proxy_set_header Host "acme.api.localhost";
      }
    }

Now the server is listening on 80 at whatever domain(s) you've
specified in DNS.
