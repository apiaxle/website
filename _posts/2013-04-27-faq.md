## Can I allow keyless entry?

Yep. I refer you to the [keyless entry](/docs/keyless-entry/)
documentation.

## The ApiAxle API has no authentication?!

No. Well, yes. You can host it behind the proxy if you need to. Say
it's bound to `locahost:8000`:

    axle> api "apiaxle" create endPoint="localhost:8000"
    axle> key "c2a5395daefa193d0d1c28c5898d8314" create
    axle> api "apiaxle" linkkey "c2a5395daefa193d0d1c28c5898d8314"

## Can I host my API at somewhere other than myapi.api.domain?

Yes. Using Nginx or other load balancing tools you should pass through
the `Host` header. For example if your API is called Acme and there
are four processes running on ports 3000-3003:

    upstream apiaxle_cluster {
      server 127.0.0.1:3000;
      server 127.0.0.1:3001;
      server 127.0.0.1:3002;
      server 127.0.0.1:3003;
    }

    server {
      listen 80;

      location / {
        proxy_pass http://apiaxle_cluster;
        proxy_set_header Host "acme.api.localhost";
      }
    }

Now the server is listening on 80 at whatever domain(s) you've
specified in DNS.

## Can I host my API on a different path part to the rest of the site?

If you want your API at `http://acme.com/api`, for example, then you
can configure thusly:

    upstream apiaxle_cluster {
      server 127.0.0.1:3000;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name acme.com www.acme.com *.acme.com;

        location /api {
                proxy_pass http://apiaxle_cluster;
                proxy_set_header Host acme.api.localhost";
         }
    }
