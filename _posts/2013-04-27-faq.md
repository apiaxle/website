## Can I allow keyless entry?

Yep. I refer you to the [keyless entry](/docs/keyless-entry/)
documentation.

## The ApiAxle API has no authentication?!

No. Well, yes. You can host it behind the proxy if you need to. Say
it's bound to `locahost:8000`:

    axle> api "apiaxle" create endPoint="localhost:8000"
    axle> key "c2a5395daefa193d0d1c28c5898d8314" create
    axle> api "apiaxle" linkkey "c2a5395daefa193d0d1c28c5898d8314"

## Can I host my API at somewhere other than myapi.api.domain?

Yes, via the apiNameRegex configuration outlined [here](/docs/configuration/).
