  <h2>In brief</h2>

  <div class="spacer-20px"></div>

  <p>
    <i class="icon-quote-left"></i> ApiAxle is a proxy that sits on
    your network*, in front of your API(s) and manages things that you
    shouldn't have to, like rate limiting, authentication and
    caching. It's fast, open and easy to configure.
    <i class="icon-quote-right"></i>
  </p>

  <div class="spacer-40px"></div>

  <p class="footnote">
    * The on-premise feature of the proxy was key to ApiAxle's model
    but there's a good chance that cloud hosted versions will be an
    option now that it's part of the Exicon family.
