## What is it?

ApiAxle is a product which might sit in front of your API and provide
services such as rate limiting and key authentication. There's a
[basic architecture description](/docs/architecture) in the
docs section.

## Why is it?

ApiAxle is different to the cloud based services such as Mashery in
that it's intended to be installed within your LAN and be managed by
you. This means **you own your users**, **you own your data** and
**you can more easily manage costs**.

## Open source

ApiAxle is **open-source**. This means you can modify it as much as
you like and contribute changes back. Others will do the same and
gradually the system will become all the better for it.

## Support & ad-hoc development

[Get in touch](mailto:phil@apiaxle.com) and we can provide new
features, integrate the API into your platform and provide support.

## Licencing

[Get in touch](mailto:phil@apiaxle.com) if you would like to
purchase a subscription to a non-GPL licence for ApiAxle.
